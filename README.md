Howtographql Frontend Example
===================


This project is an example of implementation for [howtographql frontend](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/) (ReactJS & Apollo Client).

## Overview

* **JWT Authentication:** Use JSON Web Token authentication.
* **Compatible with Backend Howtographql Tutorial:** Works with GraphQL backends builts in [Howtographql.com](https://www.howtographql.com).
* **No Includes Subscriptions:** Doesn't use GraphQL subscriptions.

## Install

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cavadev/howtographql-frontend.git
cd howtographql-frontend
```

Then

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

And finally access to the web in http://localhost:3000/

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Relay

### Without Relay version

You can see the "Without Relay" version of this code in [Tag 0.1.0](https://github.com/cavadev/howtographql-frontend/tree/0.1.0), and in your cloned repository with the next command:

```sh
git checkout tags/0.1.0
```

### With Relay version

You can see the "With Relay" version of this code in the master branch or in [Tag 0.2.0](https://github.com/cavadev/howtographql-frontend/tree/0.2.0), and in your cloned repository with the next command:

```sh
git checkout master
```

or

```sh
git checkout tags/0.2.0
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
